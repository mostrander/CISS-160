DecisionStructureBEXTRA - Megan Ostrander Test Plan

Switching the original testbox field for the shipping code to radio
buttons required me to rewrite some of the code to recognize 
when one of the buttons are selected, and then use that information
to set the zone information for the rest of the program. 
I chose to do this as a separate method and just call it, thus making
the code a little cleaner in that regard.

Changing the switch statement used for determining the zone cost to 
use and calculating the total shipping cost to an If / else statement
was just annoying. It was not difficult, but it produced substantially
more lines of code than I personally liked. Looking back at it I
probably could have rewritten that entire section as another 
standalone method and just call it and return the necessary information.
