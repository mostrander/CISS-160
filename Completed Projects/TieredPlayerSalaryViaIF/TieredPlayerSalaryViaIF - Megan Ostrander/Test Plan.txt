TieredPlayerSalaryViaIF - Megan Ostrander

This program required a good amount of reorganization after I had 
completed writing the code. I have the bulk of the processing in 
an if/else statement that verified that the number of hits input
was within the specified range 1 - 300. However, I did not include
that code within the if/else statement that validated the name input
originally. Thus, the program would generate an error message for the
name field if necessary, but it would continue to process the hit 
information given regardless.

Thus, I ultimately had to move the entire first if/else statement 
within the latter if/else statement in order to properly trigger 
the error message (when applicable) without continuing to process 
the information. 

Most of my testing revolved around verifying that the program 
was recognizing the correct tier level, thus using the correct 
salary amount per hit. I used decimal and int variables in my program,
so there was no need to cast to another variable type.

I ran the calculations manually to verify that the output was as 
expected.
