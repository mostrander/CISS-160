Test Plan CollegeCostComparisons - Megan Ostrander

This program required that I verify that the calculations were
indeed being processed correctly and producing the expected result.
I verified them by doing the calculations by hand myself, and
checking my answers against those that the computer produced based
on the way I set up the calculations in the code. 

I also used an if / else statement to set the background color
to red for the results depending on which cost was higher. I
had to add a clear statement for both result labels in order
to test that the if / else statement was indeed working properly.
If the user changes the information in the form and clicks on the
button a 2nd time, it clears the background color and sets it 
properly now based on which has the higher cost for that 
calculation.

I also included a clear button should the user want to continue
to use the program and test additional schools without closing
and relaunching the program. It was easy to verify that this worked,
as you can visually see that the contents of each field has been
removed. I added the background reset code from the calculations
button method here as well, so that the backgrounds are reset to 
white even if the user does not click on the calculate button.
