UIControlsAndMultiLine - Megan Ostrander test plan

The main challenge I encountered with this project was getting the 
textbox I used for displaying items ordered to recognize the new line
character \n. As in the textbox was not recognizing \n at all and all
of the information was being forced on the same line regardless of \n
being present. 

I found another method to create new lines in a string using the 
Environment.newline, which actually worked for my purposes. I wanted
to create more of an automation of the string concatention process
because it would allow other options to be added without having to 
rewrite a lot of code. It also saved me from having to rewrite my code
to include several other possibilities or use an array to hold whatever
values the user selected.
