Test Plan SalesTaxCalc - Megan Ostrander

The primary function that had to be checked in this program
was the sales tax calculation. What I did was create a static
variable that A) could only be used in the current class and 
B) could not be altered while the program was running.
I set this variable for tax set to the current Lorain County
rate of 6.75%, which I used .0675m to be clear about it.

I manually did the calculations myself and compared them to 
the computer output, which matched what I was expecting the
results to be. Once the tax was calculated, it was simply
a matter of adding it to the cost of purchase and displaying
the final amount owed / spent (depending on how one views 
the program's use).
