MathLibCircleInfo - Megan Ostrander

For testing this program I used the example finished product provided
as well as manual calculations to verify that the code I wrote was
properly taking the user radius input and calculating the correct
diameter, circumference, and area of the circle. 

I also looked up the formulas to ensure I remembered them correctly,
as it has been several years since I used these formulas and I 
wanted to ensure I was using the correct formulas. 

I ultimately entered a few test values into my program and the sample
program to compare their output and verify my program output matched
that of the sample program output.
