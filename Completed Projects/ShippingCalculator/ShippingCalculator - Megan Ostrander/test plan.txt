ShippingCalculator - Megan Ostrander

The hardest part of this project was getting the switch to work as 
I desired. I remembered how to setup the basic form of the switch
no problem, but the issue started when I was trying to run an if 
statement based on the shippingCost variable calculated within the
switch statement. I had forgotten that the return statements return
control to the main program, so it was NEVER reaching the if 
statement I had written after the switch statement.

I ended up putting the if statement in each of the cases, since I 
could not have it included only at the end of the switch prior to the
last return. I also HAD to have return statements for all cases, 
because none of them could fall through to the next. 

I initially felt lazy and did not want to write another method for the
if statement that determines whether shipping cost should be capped,
but I decided to do it anyway because I did not like having repeating 
code. It looked sloppy and it annoyed me.
