CalcWithAccumsB - Megan Ostrander  Test Plan

This project in particular made me want to scream bloody murder.
My only significant problem with this project was I could not find
an easy way to copy my previous code to this new project. Every
attempt I made to copy the project resulted in it being an exact
duplicate of the original that refused to changed in any manner.
If I attempted to simply copy all of the code to the new project
followed by the design layout (or vice versa), than the other would
be completely erased even after saving each paste. I also tried to 
use the "create from existing code" option visual studio offers, but
that produced an issue where I could not change the name without 
significant issues. Online guides were not very useful in this regard,
as many showed how to save to Github, and not how to create a new copy
with existing code.

Otherwise, the project went very smooth since it was simply a matter
of adding several new display fields for the output. I verified the 
calculations by hand as I did the running totals and they appeared 
right to me.
