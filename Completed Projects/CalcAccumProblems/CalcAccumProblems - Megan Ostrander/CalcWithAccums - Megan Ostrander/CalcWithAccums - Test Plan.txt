CalcWithAccums - Megan Ostrander  Test Plan

For this project, the goal was to have the user input the dimensions
of the mulch they purchased / ordered in feet (width, height, length);
Then, I needed to convert that information into cubic yards, calculate
the cost of the order based on a predetermined price, display the 
amount of space left on the order truck, and keep a running total of 
the amount of mulch ordered and overall order cost.

Once I figured out how to properly convert cubic feet into cubic yards,
the calculations themselves were not a problem. I verified the 
calculations both on paper and by comparing the results to the finished
program provided as a reference. 

I did run into a small snag after I altered how the remaining truck
capacity was calculated. I had originally created a variable to hold
the remaining capacity, but forgot about it and ended up modifying
the code when I was done to utilize it. However, when I made the change
I did not realize that it was doubling the amount that was being
taken out. I relized that I was subtracking the wrong variable and
fixed the problem.
