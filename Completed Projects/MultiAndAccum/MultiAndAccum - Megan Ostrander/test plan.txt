MultiAndAccum - Megan Ostrander

I ran into a small issue with the running total because it did not want to actually 
add the new result, and instead displayed the current result as the 
running total. I then tried to use an if else statement to force it 
to add properly, but then it simply did not show any negative values
with the negative sign in front (showed them as positive values),
and it continued to not add correctly.

I eventually realized that it had to be a variable outside of the 
calculate method to function properly.

Verifying the calculations were pretty easy. I just used small numbers
that I knew the result of without calculating to verify that the 
program was multiplying them correctly.
